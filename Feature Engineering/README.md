#Improve model accuracy: By providing clearer and more relevant features, the model can learn patterns and relationships more effectively, leading to better predictions.
Reduce model complexity: Feature engineering can simplify the data, making it easier for simpler models to perform well, reducing training time and resource needs.
Handle data issues: It helps address issues like missing values, outliers, and categorical data, ensuring smoother model training.
Types of Feature Engineering:

Feature Selection: Choosing the most informative and relevant features from your data. This can involve statistical tests, correlation analysis, or domain knowledge.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, and scaling numerical features to a common range.
Feature Creation: Generating new features that capture relationships between existing features or represent complex information in a more digestible way. Examples include:
Feature interactions: Combining features to capture non-linear relationships.
Binning: Grouping continuous features into discrete categories.
Dimensionality reduction: Techniques like PCA to reduce the number of features without losing significant information.
Feature Encoding: Converting categorical data into numerical values that the model can understand. Common methods include:
One-hot encoding: Creating binary features for each category.
Label encoding: Assigning unique integers to each category.
Frequency encoding: Encoding based on the frequency of each category.
