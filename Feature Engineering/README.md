   1. Improve model accuracy: By providing clearer and more relevant features, the model can learn patterns and relationships more 
      effectively, leading to better predictions.
      
   2. Reduce model complexity: Feature engineering can simplify the data, making it easier for simpler models to perform well, reducing         training time and resource needs.

   3. Handle data issues: It helps address issues like missing values, outliers, and categorical data, ensuring smoother model training.


Types of Feature Engineering:

  a. Feature Selection: Choosing the most informative and relevant features from your data. This can involve statistical tests,                correlation analysis, or domain knowledge.
    
  b. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, and scaling numerical features to a common     
     range.
     
  c. Feature Creation: Generating new features that capture relationships between existing features or represent complex information in a      more digestible way. 
  
 Examples include:
 
  i. Feature interactions: Combining features to capture non-linear relationships.
 ii. Binning: Grouping continuous features into discrete categories.
iii. Dimensionality reduction: Techniques like PCA to reduce the number of features without losing significant information.
 iv. Feature Encoding: Converting categorical data into numerical values that the model can understand. Common methods include:
  v. One-hot encoding: Creating binary features for each category.
 vi. Label encoding: Assigning unique integers to each category.
vii. Frequency encoding: Encoding based on the frequency of each category.
